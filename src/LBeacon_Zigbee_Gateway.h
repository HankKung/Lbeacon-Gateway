 * Project Name:
 *
 *      BeDIPS
 *
 * File Description:
 *
 *   	This file contains the program to set up a star network by XBEE S2C
 *      module in order to deal with NSI(Network Setup and Initialization)
 *      and Data transmission between Gateway and LBeacon. And This file is
 *		the header for Gateway.
 *
 * File Name:
 *
 *      LBeacon_Zigbee_Gateway.c
 *
 * Abstract:
 *
 *      BeDIPS uses LBeacons to deliver 3D coordinates and textual
 *      descriptions of their locations to users' devices. Basically, a
 *      LBeacon is an inexpensive, Bluetooth Smart Ready device. The 3D
 *      coordinates and location description of every LBeacon are retrieved
 *      from BeDIS (Building/environment Data and Information System) and
 *      stored locally during deployment and maintenance times. Once
 *      initialized, each LBeacon broadcasts its coordinates and location
 *      description to Bluetooth enabled user devices within its coverage
 *      area.
